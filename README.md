Exploratory Data Analysis with Health Data using R

The file Project.Rmd contains the code used to Explore the relation between the BMI status and anxiety in Children.

There seems to be a postive correlation between the two.

The data used is from: US National Survey of Children's Health. http://www.childhealthdata.org/learn/NSCH. The data used covers a period from 2011-2012.

I have added the cleaned data in the Data Folder. It contains 7 features including Prematurity, BMI class, Anxiety Disorder, Teeth Health, Age, State and Sex of the Child
